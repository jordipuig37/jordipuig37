### Hi there! I'm Jordi ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya in 2022 with a degree in Data Science and Engineering. My GitHub page works as a portfolio, so I'm happy to share my projects and skills. I mainly program in Python but I also have some experience with other languages.

My main interests are:

* Machine Learning and Deep Learning
* Data Visualization and communication

My goal is to develop applications, products or services to bring value to the world. You will find that most of my repos are university related; luckily in the future I'll be able to develop my own projects and share them here.
